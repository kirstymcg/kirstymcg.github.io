Since the beginning of 2024, I have been the sole technical writer at Qruise, a software company developing software to accelerate scientific research, with a strong focus on quantum computing.

In this role, I am responsible for the company’s public-facing technical documentation, including:

- defining and maintaining the documentation structure and information architecture  
- writing, editing, and keeping documentation up to date in line with product development  
- coordinating inputs across scientific and software teams to ensure clarity, accuracy, and consistency
