# Marketing & communications

Since the beginning of 2024, I have been the sole marketing and communications writer at <a href="https://qruise.com" target="_blank">Qruise</a>, a company developing software to accelerate scientific research, with a strong focus on quantum computing.

## News & press releases

I write all news articles and press releases for Qruise, which can be found <a href="https://www.qruise.com/news-and-events/news" target="_blank">here</a>, as well as the <a href="https://newsletter.qruise.com/" target="_blank">newsletter</a>. A selection is shown below:

- **Qruise expands into magnetic resonance with new simulation and control software, Resonance**

## Website content & design

I spearheaded a redesign of the company website, leading the content restructure and working closely with designers and developers to improve clarity and usability. This included redesigning the landing page, industry pages, product pages, and site navigation. You can check out the website <a href="https://qruise.com" target="_blank">here</a> and select examples are shown below:

## Blog posts

In 2026, I initiated a technical blog series exploring key challenges in quantum computing and how researchers are tackling them. I developed the concept, authored the posts, and coordinated the accompanying graphics. The first post in the series was published in January 2026.

- **Distorted Reality: How pulse distortions undermine quantum control and how to correct for them**  
  <a href="https://www.qruise.com/resources/blog/distorted-reality" target="_blank">Read online</a> · [PDF](assets/pdfs/Distorted-Reality_Qruise.pdf)

Prior to this series, I wrote a standalone technical blog post on quantum noise spectroscopy:

- **Quantum Noise Spectroscopy**
