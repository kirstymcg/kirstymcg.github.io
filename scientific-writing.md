# Scientific writing 

I worked as a scientific writer for several years during my PhD and postdoc, writing scientific news articles and wiki-style educational content.

## Physics World

*Physics World* is the world's leading physics magazine and a comprehensive multimedia science news platform published monthly by the Institute of Physics (IOP).

During my PhD, I was a student contributor for *Physics World*, writing *Research updates* on the latest papers in light&ndash;matter coupling and related photonic technologies, and continued this during my postdoctoral research.

I've selected a few examples of my articles:


- **Surface plasmon polaritons launched by nano-emitters are imaged in the near field**  
  <a href="https://physicsworld.com/a/surface-plasmon-polaritons-launched-by-nano-emitters-are-imaged-in-the-near-field/" target="_blank">Read online</a> · [PDF](assets/pdfs/Surface-plasmon-polaritons_PhysicsWorld.pdf)

- **Exciton–polaritons enhance magneto-optical responses in van der Waals crystals**  
  <a href="https://physicsworld.com/a/exciton-polaritons-enhance-magneto-optical-responses-in-van-der-waals-crystals/" target="_blank">Read online</a> · [PDF](assets/pdfs/van-der-waals_Physics_World.pdf)

- **Photonic band structure created in electrically driven OLED microcavities**  
  <a href="https://physicsworld.com/a/photonic-band-structure-created-in-electrically-driven-oled-microcavities/" target="_blank">Read online</a> · [PDF](assets/pdfs/Photonic-band-structure_PhysicsWorld.pdf)

You can find my other articles on my *Physics World* <a href="https://physicsworld.com/author/kirsty-mcghee/" target="_blank">author page</a>.

## Ossila

Ossila develops and manufactures equipment, materials, and components for advanced scientific research, specialising in organic electronics, photovoltaics, and perovskite solar cells.

I worked for Ossila in the time they were bringing their <a href="https://www.ossila.com/products/optical-spectrometer" target="_blank">spectrometer</a> onto the market. I wrote scientific content for the company website, explaining key physical concepts and mechanisms related to the optical properties of spectrometers, organic semiconductors, and molecular spectroscopy. I also created accompanying graphics &mdash; including schematics, diagrams, and experimental data &mdash; to make the resources as clear and useful to other scientists as possible.

Below are a few select examples of my work:

- **Fluorescence and Phosphorescence**  
  <a href="https://www.ossila.com/pages/fluorescence-phosphorescence" target="_blank">Read online</a> · [PDF](assets/pdfs/Fluorescence-Phosphorescence_Ossila.pdf)

- **What is Spectroscopy? Definition and Types**  
  <a href="https://www.ossila.com/pages/spectroscopy" target="_blank">Read online</a> · [PDF](assets/pdfs/Spectroscopy_Ossila.pdf)

- **How Does a Spectrometer Work? Principles Explained**  
  <a href="https://www.ossila.com/pages/spectrometer-working-principles" target="_blank">Read online</a> · [PDF](assets/pdfs/How-Does-a-Spectrometer-Work_Ossila.pdf)

- **Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) in OLEDs**  
  <a href="https://www.ossila.com/pages/thermally-activated-delayed-fluorescence" target="_blank">Read online</a> · <a href="assets/pdfs/Thermally-Activated-Delayed-Fluorescencee_Ossila.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>


**Note**: While some webpages have been updated since I wrote the original material, the linked PDFs reflect my original work.


## Springer Nature

During work shadowing at *Nature Reviews Physics*, a *Springer Nature* journal, I wrote an *In retrospect* article on Compton scattering for a quantum physics issue of the journal:

- **A century of Compton scattering**  
  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-023-00576-1" target="_blank">Read online</a> · [PDF](assets/pdfs/century-of-compton-scattering.pdf)
