# Scientific writing

I worked as a scientific writer for several years during my PhD and postdoc, writing scientific news articles and wiki-style educational content.

## Ossila

Ossila develops and manufactures equipment, materials, and components for advanced scientific research, specialising in organic electronics, photovoltaics, and perovskite solar cells.

I worked for Ossila in the time they were bringing their <a href="https://www.ossila.com/products/optical-spectrometer" target="_blank">spectrometer</a> onto the market. I wrote scientific content for the company website, explaining key physical concepts and mechanisms related to the optical properties of spectrometers, organic semiconductors, and molecular spectroscopy. I also created accompanying graphics &mdash; including schematics, diagrams, and experimental data &mdash; to make the resources as clear and useful to other scientists as possible.

Below are a few select examples of my work:

- **Fluorescence and Phosphorescence**

- **What is Spectroscopy? Definition and Types**

- **How Does a Spectrometer Work? Principles Explained**

- **Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) in OLEDs**

**Note**: While some webpages have been updated since I wrote the original material, the linked PDFs reflect my original work.

## Physics World

*Physics World* is the world's leading physics magazine and a comprehensive multimedia science news platform published monthly by the Institute of Physics (IOP).

During my PhD and postdoc, I wrote *Research updates* 

I've selected a few examples of my articles:

- **Title of article**

## Springer Nature

During work shadowing at *Nature Reviews Physics*, a *Springer Nature* journal, I wrote an *In retrospect* article on Compton scatteringfor a quantum physics issue of the journal:

- **A century of Compton scattering**
