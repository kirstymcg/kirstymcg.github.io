# Scientific writing

I worked as a scientific writer for several years during my PhD and postdoc, writing scientific news articles and wiki-style educational content.

## Ossila

Ossila develops and manufactures equipment, materials, and components for advanced scientific research, specialising in organic electronics, photovoltaics, and perovskite solar cells.

I worked for Ossila in the time they were bringing their <a href="https://www.ossila.com/products/optical-spectrometer" target="_blank">spectrometer</a> onto the market. I wrote scientific content for the company website, explaining key physical concepts and mechanisms related to the optical properties of spectrometers, organic semiconductors, and molecular spectroscopy. I also created accompanying graphics &mdash; including schematics, diagrams, and experimental data &mdash; to make the resources as clear and useful to other scientists as possible.

Below are a few select examples of my work:
